def read_mapping(lines):
    """
    Partial reader for modified Backward mapping files.

    ..warning::

        This parser is a limited proof of concept. It must be replaced! See
        [issue #5](https://github.com/jbarnoud/martinize2/issues/5).

    Read mapping from a Backward mapping file. Not all fields are supported,
    only the "molecule" and the "atoms" fields are read. The origin force field
    is assumed to be "universal", and the destination force field is assumed to
    be "martini22".

    The reader assumes only one molecule per file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lines: iterable of str
        Collection of lines to read.

    Returns
    -------
    name: str
        The name of the fragment as read in the "molecule" field.
    from_ff: list of str
        A list of force field origins. Each force field is referred by name.
    to_ff: list of str
        A list of force field destinations. Each force field is referred by name.
    mapping: dict
        The mapping. The keys of the dictionary are pairs of residue indices
        and the atom names in the origin force field as tupples (resid,
        atomname); the values are lists of resid, and atom names pairs
        in the destination force field.
    weights: dict
    extra: list
        Unmapped atoms to be added.
